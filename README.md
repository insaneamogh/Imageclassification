# Image Classification with CNN using Keras and CIFAR-10 Dataset

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using the Keras deep learning library. The model is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes. The network architecture includes convolutional layers, pooling layers, fully connected layers, and dropout for improved generalization.

## Overview

This project aims to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into one of the following classes:
1. Airplane
2. Automobile
3. Bird
4. Cat
5. Deer
6. Dog
7. Frog
8. Horse
9. Ship
10. Truck

The CNN model is built using the Keras library, and the model's performance is evaluated in terms of accuracy.

## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have the following requirements:

- Python 3.x
- Keras
- TensorFlow or other compatible deep learning backend
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

You can install the required Python packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib
